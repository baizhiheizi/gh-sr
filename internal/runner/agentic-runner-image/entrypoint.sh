#
# Startup (deterministic, single dockerd start):
#   1. Enable cgroup v2 nesting (DinD requirement).
#   2. Start the inner dockerd ONCE. host.docker.internal DNS is baked into the
#      image (/etc/docker/daemon.json pins the default-bridge gateway to 10.200.0.1
#      and points container DNS at the bundled dnsmasq) — no runtime daemon.json
#      rewrite or dockerd restart. 10.200.0.1 is used (not 172.17.0.1) because the
#      outer runner container sits on the host's default Docker bridge
#      (172.17.0.0/16); a 172.17.x inner bridge would collide with the container's
#      own gateway/eth0 subnet and black-hole all outbound traffic.
#   3. Start dnsmasq (baked config + a startup-generated upstream drop-in seeded from
#      the runner's ORIGINAL resolvers), then repoint the runner container's
#      /etc/resolv.conf at dnsmasq. gh-aw's firewall auto-detects the agent sandbox
#      DNS from that resolv.conf, so this makes host.docker.internal resolve
#      authoritatively to the AWF-exempt inner-bridge gateway for the agent too —
#      otherwise the sandbox inherits the outer host resolver and intermittently
#      routes the MCP gateway request through Squid (ERR_INVALID_URL → MCP launch
#      failure).
#   4. Install the AWF service-routing bypass (one-shot; lets AWF agents reach
#      workflow `services:` published ports).
#   5. Register the actions runner against GitHub (idempotent; one-time token).
#   6. Wire the per-job reset hooks into the runner .env.
#   7. exec run.sh (the actions runner loop).
#
# Per-job environment hygiene (clean /tmp/gh-aw, remove leftover containers, prune
# networks, flush AWF iptables) is handled by /opt/gh-sr/hooks/job-started.sh and
# /opt/gh-sr/hooks/job-completed.sh, so every job runs from a known-clean state on
# this long-lived runner. The inner Docker image-layer cache under
# /runner-state/docker-data is preserved across jobs (never pruned).
#
# Environment variables injected by `docker run`:
#   GH_SR_RUNNER_NAME   — unique runner name (e.g. "myrepo-agentic-1")
#   GH_SR_RUNNER_TOKEN  — registration token from GitHub API

#   GH_SR_AWF_SUBNET    — AWF bridge subnet for the service-routing bypass (default 172.30.0.0/24)

# ── 2. Inner-bridge subnet collision avoidance (pre-start; no restart) ──────────
# The image bakes a deterministic inner-bridge subnet into /etc/docker/daemon.json
# (10.200.0.1/24) and the dnsmasq config. 10.200.0.0/24 is chosen because it sits
# OUTSIDE Docker's default address pools (172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16), so it
# does not normally collide with anything Docker auto-allocates — including the host
# default bridge 172.17.0.0/16 that the outer runner container's eth0 usually sits on.
#
# WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS (defence in depth):
#   The *outer* runner container's networks are decided by whoever runs the image
#   (the host's Docker / orchestrator), NOT by us. A custom host could attach the
#   runner container to an arbitrary subnet — conceivably even 10.200.0.0/24, or a
#   broad 10.0.0.0/8. If the baked inner-bridge subnet overlapped one of the runner
#   container's OWN interfaces, the inner docker0 would duplicate a directly-attached
#   or gateway IP and capture that route. Outbound traffic would then be black-holed
#   into the inner bridge: the host network stays fine, but every connection made
#   inside the runner (agent → model provider, git, package installs) crawls or times
#   out. This is exactly the failure that a hardcoded 172.17.0.1 bip caused, and the
#   reason we no longer pin to the default-bridge subnet.
#
#   Docker's own IPAM auto-avoids these conflicts when `bip` is unset, but we pin
#   `bip` for a deterministic dnsmasq listen address — which bypasses that safety
#   net. This block re-adds it: it validates the baked gateway against the container's
#   CURRENT interfaces and, only on conflict, rewrites daemon.json + the dnsmasq
#   config to the first collision-free candidate.
#
# CRITICAL ORDERING: this runs BEFORE the single dockerd start below. We never write
# daemon.json after dockerd is up and we never restart dockerd — the daemon reads the
# final config on its one and only start. (The old "write daemon.json then kill +
# restart dockerd" dance was a major instability source; do not reintroduce it.)

# ── 2a. Reduced-MTU pinning (optional; strictly before the single dockerd start) ─
# GH_SR_HOST_MTU is injected by `docker create` (internal/runner/container.go) with the
# MTU of the HOST's primary egress interface when it is below Docker's 1500 default —
# e.g. cloud overlay networks (GCP defaults to 1460), VPN/WireGuard, or nested
# virtualisation. It can also be forced via runners.yml (container_runner_image.mtu).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the outer runner container sits on the host's default Docker bridge
# (MTU 1500) and the inner dockerd bridge also defaults to 1500. When the real host path
# MTU is smaller and PMTUD is black-holed (ICMP "fragmentation needed" filtered — very
# common), small packets pass (DNS, TCP SYN/ACK) so connections OPEN, but large packets
# are silently dropped. TLS handshakes (ServerHello + certificate chain span several
# full-size segments) then stall and the socket is torn down mid-handshake. Node-based
# downloads surface this as "Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS
# connection was established" — exactly how actions/setup-go fails on such hosts while
# the host itself downloads fine (its real NIC never emits oversized frames).
#
# Pinning the inner bridge MTU (daemon.json, below) AND the outer container's egress
# interface MTU (further down) to the host's real MTU makes TCP advertise a matching MSS
# in BOTH directions, so large TLS packets fit and never depend on PMTUD. We only ever
# LOWER the MTU; an unset/≥1500 value leaves Docker's 1500 default untouched.
