# gh-sr job-started hook — runs after a job is assigned, before its steps run.
#
# Wired via ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED (see entrypoint.sh). Runs as a
# synchronous "Set up runner" step. It guarantees a pristine inner environment
# for the job:
#
#   1. Aggressively reset leftover inner state. ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED runs
#      "when a job has been assigned to a runner, but before the job starts running"
#      (GitHub docs) — i.e. BEFORE the job lifecycle's prepare_job step that creates the
#      job/service (`services:`) containers and network. So removing ALL inner containers
#      here cannot touch the current job's containers; it only reaps leftovers from a
#      previous job whose completed-hook did not run (e.g. the runner was killed mid-job).
#   2. Verify the inner dockerd is responsive. This is the only hard failure: if
#      dockerd is down the job cannot run anyway, and failing here surfaces a clear
#      message in "Set up runner" instead of a confusing failure minutes later.
#
# The hook runs as the runner user and talks to the inner dockerd through the
# /var/run/docker.sock socket (group `docker`, which the runner is in). Never
# removes images / volumes — the /runner-state/docker-data image cache is
# preserved so the job does not re-pull gh-aw's images.

# 2. Arm the AWF service bridge (opt-in: runners.yml `awf_service_bridge: true`,
#    agentic profile only — propagated via the runner .env). This hook runs
#    before prepare_job creates the job's service containers/network and long
#    before the agent step creates awf-net, so the bridge joins from a detached
#    waiter (it polls for both networks and exits once joined, on timeout, or
#    when job-completed.sh kills it). See hooks/awf-service-bridge.sh.
